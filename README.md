# Data_visualization_using_PyQt_designer
#problem : a manufacturing comppany wants to provide thier user a simple interfaces in order to watch the performances of different sensors connected in the machine. They call their Techniical intern for providing a solution.
#Technical_intern ( ME ): I will make GUI with tkinter that will retrieve data from the sensors and provide all the necessary graphs and also manipulation techniques in order to see the Performances!

Application description : often when providing the users with simple interfaces require a Basic dash Board with less amount of package size. therefore, traditional Power_BI approaches are not applicable here as they neeed a huge amount of space and not necessary to say training, thats where my python comes in action, it will generate an aplication that will hep user to click on thier sensor data type and see their performances very conviently inside the IOT not even connected to any public database. Traditional Power_BI approches are data base dependent, where they provide cross platform support but not very efficient in one to one connection!. I will also upload  the power  BI file here, when i will be finished with my Lidar project to feel the real difference why this application hqas the most usability than the power-BI!
